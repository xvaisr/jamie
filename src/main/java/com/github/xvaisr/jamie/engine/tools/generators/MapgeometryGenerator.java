     * Idea summary. Figure out and write simple grammar for LTL system. Small array of height information
     * will be generated. This complex terrain information should be simplified by the grammar. Some areas
     * should be flattend and some areas should be more pronnounced. Following this there should be some
     * algorithm that finds effective edges of the se areas. Maybe these edges could be found during the
     * proccesing of an array by the gramar. This should be able to create small portions of a landscape
     * that could be later connected to each other.
